- Fantasy_Football_Projections_RB.csv is a dataset with the average standard fantasy scoring projections from the top 4 fantasy football websites

## Project Content

- The project contains the main file, which opens the Fantasy_Football_Projections_RB.csv, groups the data by team, and sorts in ascending order next a summary of statistics containing the mean, median (50%) & standard deviation, and two graphs are generated: one bar chart and the second a scatter graph.
